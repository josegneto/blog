The *CheckMates* project was developed in the context of *Programming Laboratories*, a 4th year course in FEUP's MIEEC. I worked with Andr√© Arag√£o, Andr√© Silva and Jos√© Pedro, who I hope are doing great in their careers.

Disclaimer: the product has a some bugs, but the game is functional.~

The following image depicts a timed game, a feature of the app.

The server is currently down, as it needed to be connected to a PostgresSQL database hosted by FEUP's services, which I can't access after concluding my studies. ü§°
