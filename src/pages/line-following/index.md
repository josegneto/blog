Security is important. Nobody wants to be the person advocating for less security. So nobody wants to say it. But somebody has to say it.

So I guess I’ll say it.

**The way `npm audit` works is broken. Its rollout as a default after every `npm install` was rushed, inconsiderate, and inadequate for the front-end tooling.**

Have you heard the story about [the boy who cried wolf?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf) Spoiler alert: the wolf eats the sheep. If we don’t want our sheep to be eaten, we need better tools.

As of today, `npm audit` is a stain on the entire npm ecosystem. The best time to fix it was before rolling it out as a default. The next best time to fix it is now.

In this post, I will briefly outline how it works, why it’s broken, and what changes I’m hoping to see.
